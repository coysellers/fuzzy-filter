# fuzzy-filter
A basic search filter built with JavaScript. This project is part of a personal effort to keep learning, set asside frameworks momentarily, and build more things using only Javascript.

## Getting Started
To demo this, clone or download the repo, run `npm install`, then run:
```bash
$ gulp watch
```
Or demo a working version here in my [CodePen](https://codepen.io/coysellers/full/Qqrorx/)
